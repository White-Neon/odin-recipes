        <p>You deserve more than one-minute rice, Try our Fired Rice!</p>

    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>⅔ cup chopped baby carrots</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen green peas</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 cups leftover cooked and chilled white rice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Steps
        <li>Cook your veg. Stir-fry garlic, scallion whites, peas, and carrots in a large wok or nonstick frying pan. </li>
        <li>Add the rice. Make sure to break up any clumps, toss to combine, and add your seasonings. </li>
        <li>Scramble the eggs. Push the fried rice to one side of the pan, then add your eggs to the other side. The eggs are scrambled in the pan while they’re getting slowly cooked, and then folded into the fried rice to finish. (This technique is used in a lot of stir-fries and dry noodle dishes, and it’s really fun to do too!)</li>
        <li>Finish the fried rice. Drizzle with sesame oil and garnish with scallion greens. </li>
    </ol>
